The project overall was pretty simple once I figured out the sturcture of the example in the video. First I determined the type of elements that were visable in the video and worked from there. The example showed a box that was centered on the page that changed color based on the timer, so it must use a if then statement once x <=0 in order to function. The box size required some exploring on the internet and trial and error in order to get the right dimensions. For the text I put in a sript that places them in a 13 columes, based on the font inside the box. I didn't get the right colors right away though I need to use http://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp which I opened in another tab to compare two example with my work.  I ran into an issue with making the timer text disappear once it completed its function so I got a tip from a tutorial on youtube to add a new code of the same but different format to overlay on top of the text. The 20-0 in 5 sec required a lot of refreshing and timing but I believe it is pretty close to the example in not off by a .01 decmal place.
Although most of the time I refered to http://www.w3schools.com for most of the set up on how to order and arrange my code in a working fashion.Another tutorial that explains how to right the code for this project really well and was my go to was http://www.developphp.com/video/JavaScript/Countdown-Timer-Tutorial-setTimeout-clearTimeout.
